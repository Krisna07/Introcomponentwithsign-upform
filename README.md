# Introcomponentwithsign-upform
Created with StackBlitz ⚡️
This is a React functional component that renders a form for a website that offers a 7-day free trial. The user is required to enter their first name, last name, email address, and password to claim the free trial. The component uses state to keep track of the user input, error messages, and submission status.

The state is managed using the useState hook. The user state object stores the user input for the form fields. The err state object keeps track of the error messages for each field. The submit state variable is used to store the submission status of the form.

The component also uses the useEffect hook to clear the submit state variable after 20 seconds if it has been set.

When the user submits the form, the handleSubmit function is called. It first validates each field and updates the err state object accordingly. If all fields are valid, it sets the submit state variable with a success message.

The component renders the form with input fields for each user attribute and an error message for each field if the input is invalid. When the user submits the form, the success message is displayed, and the form is reset.

The component also includes SVG graphics to indicate errors next to the corresponding error messages. The component renders a button to initiate the free trial and a message indicating that the user is agreeing to the website's terms and conditions by submitting the form.
